Oh hey! I caught you bro... hahaha 👀  
You really cloned it, didn’t you?  
Didn’t even hesitate, huh?

Looking for the next million-dollar startup idea?  
Sorry bro — just a gentle reminder:

👋 If you're gonna take the repo,  
at least take a second to follow the human behind it 💚

No stars, no follow...  
but still had time to clone?  
That’s wild 😭

One click won’t hurt —  
but ignoring devs who create stuff? That’s cold 💔

– With love,  
  The repo you just cloned.
