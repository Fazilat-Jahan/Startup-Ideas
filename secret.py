Oh hey! I caught you bro... hahaha ðŸ‘€  
You really cloned it, didnâ€™t you?  
Didnâ€™t even hesitate, huh?

Looking for the next million-dollar startup idea?  
Sorry bro â€” just a gentle reminder:
Following someone and appreciating their work...  
that's a startup idea too ðŸ’¡ðŸ˜‰


ðŸ‘‹ If you're gonna take the repo,  
at least take a second to follow the human behind it ðŸ’š

No stars, no follow...  
but still had time to clone?  
Thatâ€™s wild ðŸ˜­

One click wonâ€™t hurt â€”  
but ignoring devs who create stuff? Thatâ€™s cold ðŸ’”

If something I built made it to your machine,
maybe I deserve a small space in your following list too?

Itâ€™s free. It helps. And it honestly means a lot ðŸ’š

â€“ With love,  
  The repo you just cloned.
